Will be a comprehensive stego tool


So far just implementing generic functions and BMP file parsing. Will add more complex image formats once the generic functions are done.

Will be implementing :

1) Left->Right LSB
2) Right->Right LSB
3) Wave Function LSB

4) Left->Right Color Encoding
5) Right->Right Color Encoding
6) Wave Function Color Encoding

Likely much more but will focus on this for now.

Plan to support BMP, PNG, JPG, may branch into video files eventually if I desire the ability to encode large files.
