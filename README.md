Will be a comprehensive stego tool


So far just implementing generic functions and BMP file parsing. Will add more complex image formats once the generic functions are done.

Will be implementing :

Left->Right LSB
Right->Right LSB
Wave Function LSB

Left->Right Color Encoding
Right->Right Color Encoding
Wave Function Color Encoding

Likely much more but will focus on this for now.

Plan to support BMP, PNG, JPG, may branch into video files eventually if I desire the ability to encode large files.
